# Mygreenstocks

This project is born so that people could easily have a picture of how sustainable their stock portfolio is.

Please keep in min that I am using my personal API_KEY for now, we will be limited to 300 query a minute (if still up). Else, you can easily change the API_KEY in the code, line 14. 

You will find a Python file to run on your machine or a .exe button in the dist file.

"best_in_class.xlsx" is an extract of the best stocks given by "Financial Data Prep". Keep in mind that this is regarding "ESG Risk Score" and not other grades.

In case you wanted to download you stock portfolio directly, you can import it if it respects the format given in the file "your_stock_example.xlsx"
