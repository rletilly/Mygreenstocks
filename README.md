I am excited to give out my spontaneous candidature for a position at Radicant. Coming from the consulting world, I've watched Radicant disrupt the banking ecosystem while promoting strong commitments on sustainability and investment practices. After taking the time to experience banking in its traditional ways in France, Luxembourg and Switzerland, I want to take on new challenges and be a part of the next banking generation. 

Originally from an engineer background in IT applied to finance, I've always searched for on-field experience and merge it with theoric knowledge. With this in mind, I started as a credit analyst in France for medium and large companies. I got to see how financing and investment risk was managed both at bank and client level. ![image](https://github.com/rletilly/Mygreenstocks/assets/55627422/ad50ef0d-ac58-4c0b-970d-15f0d23c255b)
