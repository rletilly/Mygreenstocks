Dear hiring manager,

I am excited to give out my spontaneous candidature for a position at Radicant. Coming from the consulting world, I've watched Radicant disrupt the banking ecosystem while promoting strong commitments on sustainability and investment practices. After taking the time to experience banking in its traditional ways in France, Luxembourg, and Switzerland, I want to take on new challenges and take part in the next banking generation.

Originally from an engineering background in IT applied to finance, I've always applied theoretical knowledge of finance to practical cases. I started my career as a credit analyst for a bank financing medium and large companies in France. I got to see how investments and risks were managed, both at the bank and client level, and how to analyze the real impact of a company through its activities. This experience showed me numerous "on-field" jobs and the backbone of a bank's business. Through those months, I also witnessed the lack of digital services and the technological burden it has internally and on clients. With this in mind, I decided to head over to BearingPoint, a digital transformation consulting company. Here I executed three missions, including the definition of a target operating model for a banking software editor, the implementation of ECMS, a new European financial platform for central banks and ICSDs, and finally, I was the product owner and test manager of a PMS in a Swiss private bank. In addition, I also invested myself in BearingPoint's "Sustainable finance" community by writing articles and participating in their offer development.

These experiences gave me a concrete vision of the financial market in Europe as well as an understanding of its actors' needs. I also realized that ESG, green finance, and sustainability can sometimes mean nothing more than a word or a constraint to those actors. I thrive to get involved a lot more in the transformation I believe is the most crucial: a sustainable and renewable one of finance practices and offers.

In a personal project, I recently worked on a website that would give out for any given stocks on the market their ESG scores as well as an overall portfolio grade. This project gave me the opportunity to understand ESG reportings, their flaws and potential improvements. This project allowed me to deepen my knowledge of ESG criteria and their relevance in evaluating companies.

Overall my consultancy experience has taught me the expectations of a client-facing job and the importance of strong communication and resilient deliverables. I was able to develop both my problem-solving and management skills to make them fit in any given situation.

I come out of this experience with a strong consultancy and project management knowledge. I now thrive for a journey more in line with my personal beliefs and ventures. Radicant is to me an obvious answer to my endeavors and a great step towards a more sustainable banking environment. 
But since actions speak louder than words, I would gladly prove my worth during an interview. 
I hope my next adventure will be ours, and I will be waiting for your answer!

Best regards,
Ronan


Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my enthusiastic interest in a position at Radicant. Having witnessed Radicant's remarkable disruption of the banking ecosystem while promoting strong commitments to sustainability and investment practices, I am inspired to contribute my skills and expertise to the next generation of banking.

Coming from an engineering background focused on IT applied to finance, I have consistently bridged theoretical finance knowledge with practical applications. Beginning my career as a credit analyst for a bank financing large companies in France, I gained valuable insights into investment and risk management at both the bank and client levels. Through this experience, I acquired a deep understanding of companies impacts through their activities and the backbone of a bank's business. Furthermore, I observed the challenges posed by the absence of digital services and the technological burden faced by both banks and their clients.

Motivated by the need for change, I transitioned to BearingPoint, a renowned digital transformation consulting company. During my tenure, I successfully executed three missions: defining a target operating model for a banking software editor, implementing ECMS (a new European financial platform for central banks and ICSDs), and serving as the product owner and test manager of a PMS, for a Swiss private bank. Additionally, I actively engaged with BearingPoint's "Sustainable Finance" community, contributing articles and participating in the development of the "sustainability" offering.

These experiences have provided me with a comprehensive understanding of the European financial market and the specific needs of its stakeholders. They have also highlighted the disparity between rhetoric and action when it comes to ESG, green finance, and sustainability. Motivated by my belief in the importance of a sustainable and renewable financial future, I am eager to contribute significantly to the transformation of finance practices and offerings.

In a recent personal project, I developed a website that provides ESG scores for individual stocks as well as an overall portfolio grade. This endeavor allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of ESG reporting, its limitations, and the potential for improvement. I am confident that this knowledge and experience will enable me to contribute effectively to Radicant's commitment to sustainability.

Throughout my consultancy career, I have honed my client-facing skills, emphasizing strong communication and delivering resilient solutions. I have cultivated prodound problem-solving and management abilities, allowing me to adapt seamlessly to any situation.

With a strong foundation in consultancy and project management, I am now seeking an opportunity that aligns more closely with my personal beliefs and aspirations. Radicant represents the perfect match for my endeavors and a significant step towards fostering a more sustainable banking environment. 
Since actions speak louder than words, I would gladly demonstrate my capabilities during an interview.

Thank you for considering my application. I eagerly anticipate the opportunity to embark on this exciting journey together. I look forward to your positive response.

Best regards,
Ronan
