# Mygreenstocks

This project is born so that people can easily have a picture of how sustainable their stock portfolio is.\

You will find a Python file to run on your machine, I am working on a .exe button.\

"best_in_class.xlsx" is an extract of the best stocks given by "Financial Data Prep". Keep in mind that this is regarding "ESG Risk Score" and not other grades.\

In case you wanted to download you stock portfolio directly, you can import it if it respects the format given in the file "your_stock_example.xlsx\
